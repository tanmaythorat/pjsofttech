            <h4>Pre-Admission Process:</h4>
            <p>The pre-admission process for educational institutions encompasses several key steps aimed at facilitating a smooth transition for prospective students into the institution. It begins with prospective student inquiries, where individuals express interest in the institution's academic programs and facilities. Comprehensive information is then disseminated to these prospective students, covering admission requirements, application procedures, and available financial aid options.</p>
            <h4>Post-Admission Process:</h4>
            <p>The post-admission process in educational institutions is pivotal for ensuring a seamless transition and fostering student success. Once students are admitted, the institution initiates a series of steps to facilitate their integration into campus life and academic endeavors. <br/><br/>This process typically involves several key components, including enrollment confirmation, orientation programs, course registration, and academic advising. Upon receiving admission offers, students are required to confirm their enrollment by submitting necessary documents and enrollment deposits.</p>
